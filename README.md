# README for my-OSSLs

## Overview

This repository contains several variations of the **Off-Scratch Software License (OSSL)**, designed specifically for Scratch and TurboWarp developers transitioning their projects to platforms like GitHub. Each license reflects different philosophies and usage permissions.

---

## Licenses Included

### 1. **DT-OSSL (Delta Off-Scratch Software License) 2.x**

- **Not OSI-compliant**  
- Focuses on protecting community values: free sharing, remixing, and restricting unmodified commercial selling  
- Encourages transparency on modifications  
- Recommended for projects that want to stay *community-first* but not fully open source  

### 2. **DTO-OSSL (Delta OPEN Off-Scratch Software License) 2.1**

- **OSI-compliant and Open Source**  
- Permits commercial use and redistribution, including selling, under typical open source conditions  
- Suitable for projects wanting broad adoption and open source compatibility

## Which License Should You Use?

| Use Case                                                           | Recommended License      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Protect community sharing, restrict unmodified selling, allow remixing | **DT-OSSL 2.x**         |
| Need full OSI-compliant open source license, including commercial selling | **DTO-OSSL 2.1**        |

---

## Why Multiple Licenses?

The different licenses serve different purposes:

- **DT-OSSL** embodies a middle ground between fully open source and free software with some restrictions to maintain community values.
- **DTO-OSSL** is a fully OSI-compliant open source license for wider industry compatibility.

## How to Use These Licenses

- Choose the license that best fits your project goals.
- Include the full license text with your project.
- If you want to commercialize your project unmodified, use the DTO-OSSL license.
- For community projects, DT-OSSL is often a better fit.
- Clearly state which license applies in your projectâ€™s README or license file.
