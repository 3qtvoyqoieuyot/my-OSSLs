# my-OSSLs
These licenses are designed to protect software created by Scratch and TurboWarp developers moving to off-platform development environments, ensuring free sharing and remixing with community protections.
**DTO-OSSL: what’s different?**
DTO-OSSL is compliant with OSI and OSD, so it can legally be called Open-Source, unlike the DT-OSSL. Here’s what’s removed/modified:
Free redistribution (including selling)
Derived works
Commercial use
No discrimination (use cases or users)
No restrictions on redistribution
Irrevocable rights
If you use the DT-OSSL, don’t refer to it as open-source software if you want to be taken seriously in any legal sense. Here are some alternative terms:
“Freely distributable”
"Community source"
"Restricted-free software"
"DT-licensed software"
"Free software with restrictions"
"Publicly licensed"
"Delta-free software"
"Community-first licensing"
"Transparent source licensing"
